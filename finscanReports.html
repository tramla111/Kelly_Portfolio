  <div class="flex-child-element magenta"><h2>Overview</h2>

  <p class= "details">Premium Reports serve as an indispensable tool for Professional Services, facilitating meticulous data analysis. This platform offers two pivotal features: firstly, it empowers clients with insights into instances where their records undergo segmentation, ensuring transparency in the process; secondly, it adeptly identifies pairs of records tagged as duplicates, enhancing data integrity. Despite the evident value proposition, the current adoption of Premium Reports remains somewhat limited within the client base.

  <p class="text1">Our process on FinScan Premium Reports is based on on a crafted UX Process timeline that is similar to the Lean UX Process. We aim to incorporate the key phases of Research, Empathize, Ideate, Test, and Develop.

    <br><br>
    <img class= "process" src="images/uxtimeline.jpg"></img>
    <br>

    Breaking it down, we are focusing on designing a user friendly interface to make records less overwhelming to scan through, offer key features that clients find valuable and allowing users to navigate to what they're searching for in a timely manner.

<div class="flex-parent-element">
  <div class="flex-child-element magenta">  <div class="projectDetailH2">Understanding the Problem</div>
  <p class="text1">Before joining Innovative Systems, there were mockups created for the Reports page but no usability test were conducted which was ineffective in determining whether the users experiences were improved or not. I conducted research interviews with primary clients and account managers to uncover pain points that they were experiencing with the existing reports.
    <br><br>
  In the scope of my user research, I followed these criterion:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet"><b>Understand the user goals and needs.</b>
</li>

<li class="bullet"><b>Identify challenges within the current user journey.</b>
</li>

<li class="bullet"><b>Assess task effectiveness through established task metrics.</b>
</li>

</ul>

<p class="text1">The main issue with Premium Reports is their lack of valuable information for users. Users find the report layout cramped and some sections misleading. Notably, under cleanse and deduplication results, original records before segmentation aren't shown, and parent records of duplicates aren't identified. This missing context diminishes the value and utility of Premium Reports, failing to meet user goals effectively. Addressing these gaps through improved content presentation and contextual information will enhance the report's value and user experience.

    Content inventory is a result of cataloging a product's whole content in an easy-to-access manner. Creating this table allows us to better understand what types of pages and content are being created and how it is organized.â€‹ This is a great method to determine the quality of content on Premium Reports and whether it needs to be updated or removed.

  <p class="text1">
    After conducting user interviews with clients, I proceeded to engage in the process of affinity mapping alongside my colleague. This endeavor was aimed at the amalgamation of the identified pain points, wherein we meticulously categorized these challenges based on common themes and pertinent features within the product.


  </p>

  <img class="green" src="images/diagram2.jpg"></img>

  <p class="text4">
  I embraced a methodology firmly rooted in data-driven insights, specifically harnessing the potency of the severity framework, to not only inform my procedural course but also to categorize usability concerns in an order of importance. This framework plays a pivotal role in discerning the degree of severity associated with each usability challenge, a computation contingent on the amalgamation of three variables:</p>

  <p class="header">Severity = Task Criticality (TC) Ã— Impact (I) Ã— Frequency (F)
  </p>

  <ul>
<li class="bullet2">Task Criticality (TC) - A measure of the task's significance to the user, gauged on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicates low importance and 5 denotes critical significance.
</li>

<li class="bullet2">Impact (I) - The magnitude of influence exerted by the issue on the user's task accomplishment, graded on a scale from 1, indicating a mere suggestion, to 5, signifying an impediment of monumental proportions.
</li>

<li class="bullet2">Frequency (F) - The occurrence frequency, expressed as a percentage, determined by the issue's prevalence across the entire participant pool.

    </li>

    <li class="bullet2">50% were <strong>frustrated</strong> when scanning through whether a duplicate was a parent or single from cleanse and duplicate results.
    </li>

    <li class="bullet2">83% of users found that it would be <strong>easier</strong> and more <strong>convenient</strong> to have a filter system to generate reports based on their desired fields.

    </div>

    <p class="text4">Drawing from the insights through affinity diagramming and a comprehensive evaluation of the current product, our collaborative team effort culminated in the delineation of the main features users found valuable. These encompass the processes of configuration before the report gets generated. This is a new feature that will be added enabling our users to customize what kind of information they want to see on their reports instead of getting it generated by default.

      <br><br>

      This dynamic entry point serves the dual purpose of not only introducing the platform but also enticing new users to explore its offerings. I have developed an information architecture that underpins the site's structure and functionality.

    <div class="projectDetail"><h3 class="subheader">Wireframing The Solution</h3>

      <p class="text4">In response to the problems identified through user research, we attempted to alleviate these user concerns by formulating potential solutions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li class="bullet2">Devising a configuration interface that empowers users to generate tailor-made reports aligning with their specific data requisites.
        </li>

        <li class="bullet2">Imposing a more distinct visual hierarchy, achieved through the consolidation of related fields, to enhance overall clarity.
        </li>

        <li class="bullet2">Streamlining the user journey by curtailing the number of steps required, thereby minimizing time investment for task completion.
        </li>

        <li class="bullet2">Concentrating efforts on essential data fields while eliminating extraneous elements that lack relevance.
        </li>
      </ul>


      <p class="text4">I mocked up low fidelity wireframes to gather feedback from stakeholders encompassing Product, Engineering, and users on the holistic arrangement and layout of the Reports page.

<div class="flex-parent-element">
  <div class="flex-child-element magenta">  <div class="projectDetailH2">Design Iterations</div>
  <p class="text1">The original FinScan Premium Reports gave most of the information that clients needed about their cleansed data. However, it had many user experience issues:

  </p>

  <ul>
      <li class="bullet">Primary interactions are not prioritized.</li>
      <li class="bullet">The interactive and export options only allow a limited number of pages on a report. This prevents us from showing all possible results of cleanse/duplicates that users wish to see.</li>
      <li class="bullet">On the reports fields, "generated record count per application" and "total all together" is designed in a very clumped-up way, making it unpleasant for users to have a good experience.</li>
      <li class="bullet">Under the cleanse and deduplication results, the table is unclean with many different pieces of information which makes it overcrowded resulting in bad readability.</li>
      <li class="bullet">In the Duplicate Family Size, the table is displayed in a very unorganized way with no sense of hierarchy.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text4">After going over all the issues with my clients, I started mocking up design solutions for each Reports page. Below is a comparison between the original product detailed page and the redesigned one.

  <div class="flex-child-element magenta">  <div class="projectDetailH2">Final Design</div>

  <p class="text1">After conducting usability testing, we took proactive steps to enhance the design in alignment with user feedback. A prominent adjustment involved the incorporation of FinScan's distinct brand colors into our color palette. Moreover, we reorganized certain categories within the "Duplication Results Status" section to emphasize the hierarchy and improve user understanding. Additionally, we fine-tuned terminology within the "Duplicate Family Size" to better align with user preferences.</p>

  <p class="text1">
    Since the implementation of the new redesign of Premium Reports, there is a decrease in the number of complaints. Additionally, users are happy about the configuration screen, praising on how useful it is when looking for specific applications and type of cleanse/duplicate results. Clients spoke highly about how organized the data fields are and how it saves them a large proportion of their time. <br><br>Some key takeaways from this project are:
  </p>

<ul>
<li class="bullet"><strong>Create a plan to launch an MVP.</strong> <br>This serves a dual purpose: firstly, in effectively addressing extraneous demands that possess the capacity to deviate the project from its intended course; and secondly, in ensuring the timely delivery of a product of exceptional caliber.
</li>
<br>
<li class="bullet"><strong>Usability Testing doesn't end after development.</strong> <br>Design embodies an ongoing cycle of refining the user experience, a perpetual endeavor aimed at enhancement. Always find ways to father and listen to user's feedback on the product whether it's in the process of being created or already created. There are always opportunities to make the user experience better.
</li>
<br>
<li class="bullet"><strong>Always involve front and back end teams.</strong> <br>This helps reduce any work that needs to be put in later when there is a technical error in missing a important feature or interaction in the mockup screens. Working closely with these teams help everyone better envision and understand the product on the same level and improve efficiency.
