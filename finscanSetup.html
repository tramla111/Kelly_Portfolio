  Informed by our comprehensive interviews and meticulous analysis, we have gained a profound comprehension of the varying degrees of importance attributed to different features.

  <p class="text4">Drawing from the insights through affinity diagramming and a comprehensive evaluation of the current product, our collaborative team effort culminated in the delineation of three pivotal features. These encompass the processes of File Uploading or Accessing Existing Files, Configuration of Environmental Variables and the Streamlining of Grammar Paths & Country Standardization, as well as the Modification of Dictionaries to facilitate a premium user setup.

  <br><br>

  Furthermore, our strategic design approach extends to the incorporation of a captivating landing page. This dynamic entry point serves the dual purpose of not only introducing the platform but also enticing new users to explore its offerings. I have developed an information architecture that underpins the site's structure and functionality.

  <p class="text4">  During this phase, our engagement with stakeholders led us to address certain challenges. A significant portion of the participants in the focus group lacked familiarity with wireframes, prompting a preference for visual components infused with FinScan's branding colors. Additionally, valuable insights were shared, including suggestions to eliminate redundancies and optimize feedback messages, ensuring they seamlessly coexist alongside user activities rather than causing interruptions. We progressed to crafting high-fidelity prototypes.

  <div class="projectDetailH33"><h3 class="italic">Think from different users' perspectives. Elaborate more thoroughly to effectively communicate concepts.</h3></div>

  <p class="text4">During our usability testing, which involved a focus group, we identified a challenge: ISI Clients struggled to grasp our ideas, such as "landing page." This experience taught me the importance of empathy in my approach. I've learned to simplify my design explanations, avoiding excessive technical jargon, as if I were explaining them to someone completely unfamiliar with the subject matter.</p>

  <div class="projectDetailH33"><h3 class="italic">Embrace constructive criticism throughout the project.</h3></div>
  <p class="text4">We had the opportunity of engaging with our users face-to-face. Their feedback proved to be highly insightful, though at times, it was candid to the point of being uncomfortable. I distinctly remember one user saying, "I don't like the design; it feels disconnected to me". Initially, it stung, but I decided to delve deeper, asking the user to elaborate on what aspects of the design made them feel disconnected and which elements they found displeasing. To my surprise, the conversation was not as intimidating as I had anticipated, and it turned out to be immensely beneficial in guiding us towards refining the final design.</p>
