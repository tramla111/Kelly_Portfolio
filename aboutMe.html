  <p class="text1">
    I graduated from Cornell University, where I specialized in UX Design and obtained a comprehensive understanding of UX/UI and product design methodologies. I've enriched my knowledge through a blend of coursework, hands-on workshops, insightful blog readings, active participation in UX organizations, and dedicated application of these principles to personal projects. My approach to design is rooted in holistic thinking, where I derive immense satisfaction from taking products from the initial spark of ideation all the way through to their full-fledged development.
     <br><br>
    My minor in business provides me with a valuable perspective in the world of UX design. It equips me with a deep understanding of the strategic and practical aspects of product development, user engagement, and project management. This knowledge empowers me to create user-centered solutions that not only enhance the user experience but also align with the broader goals and objectives of business.

  <p class="values"><span class="peach">Embrace Constructive Feedback.</span></p>
  <p class="text1">Don't be afraid of negative comments. We all learn from feedback whether it's from a client, our team, or any other stakeholders involved. Incorporating feedback into the UX design process is not just a practice but a core value. It reflects a commitment to creating products that truly serve their intended audience while promoting growth, learning, and innovation within the design team.
  </p><br>


  <p class="values"><span class="pale">Always Be Open to Learning New Things.</mark></p>
  <p class="text1">I firmly believe that humans are perpetually evolving and benefit greatly from receiving constructive feedback as a catalyst for growth. Personally, I'm continuously exploring avenues to challenge and enhance my skills. In my leisure time, I immerse myself in insightful blogs, explore new projects, and attend workshops, all of which contribute to my ongoing development.
  </p><br>

  <p class="values"><span class="celery">Design with Personality.</span></p>
  <p class="text1">To enhance user engagement and attract a broader user base, it's crucial to incorporate a character or personality that resonates with the specific user persona we're designing for. It's a common challenge for users to connect with designs, devices, or code that feel devoid of life or personality.

    Infusing your design with personality imbues it with a human touch, rendering it not only more appealing but also more user-friendly. This approach fosters a deeper connection between the user and the product or experience, ultimately contributing to a more satisfying and effective design.
  </p><br>


  <p class="values"><span class="lavender">Stay Humble.</span></p>
  <p class="text1">  Regardless of your position, extend respect to others as you would to yourself. After all, we are all humans, sharing common desires and requirements, and confronting our own daily struggles. Stay authentic to yourself and remain authentic in your interactions with others. Treats other like how you want to be treated and stay positive!
