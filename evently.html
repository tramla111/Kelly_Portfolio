  <p class="text1"> College students are constantly seeking out opportunities to participate in community events, to make new connections, and to shape their identity. Despite efforts to solve this problem (CampusGroups, flyers, etc), we continually see the same questions resurfacing:

<br><br>
    <img class= "imageCenter" src="images/project1_subImage1.jpg"> </img>

    <br>
    With this research, our major objective is to completely revamp and reimagine a solution that would help students stay up to date and learn about events on/off campus that fit their work schedules, but also consider the less obvious factors of logistical concerns and friends.
    <br><br>
    Through a qualitative study, we conducted a co-design session involving hands-on activities, auto-ethnography, and diary studies. Our team designed an application that accommodates the needs/challenges of users when it comes to finding events, taking into account insights from these research methods.
    <br><br>
    I was responsible for preparing for the co-design session, analyzing data from user research methods, and UX/UI design for the application which increase internal workflow efficiency and facilitate more effective event searching among students based on personal interests.

  <div class="flex-child-element magenta">  <div class="projectDetailH2">Understanding the Problem</div>
  <p class="text1">One of the significant challenges when it comes to connecting people with events is rooted in the human desire for convenience. Often, individuals don't plan their outings well in advance and might not be inclined to go out of their way to meet new people. Consequently, they tend to choose events that are close and easily accessible to them.
<br><br>
    Moreover, the concept of homophily, which refers to our tendency to associate with those who are similar to us, heavily influences the social relationships we form. This has a profound impact on our interactions and the events we attend.

<br>
    Intriguingly, in 2013, researchers made noteworthy strides by harnessing wireless technology for location tracking. Their findings revealed that factors such as the physical proximity of users, similarities in their movement patterns, and shared interests could be leveraged to facilitate friendship matching. This technology has the potential to enhance social connections in various settings, including workplaces, conferences, and other places where people interact.
    <br><br>
    Here are key challenges and goals discovered through the analysis of literature and related research & development. Our team has uncovered unique perspectives on possible ways of addressing this "wicked problem".

    </div>

    <div class="projectDetail"><h3 class="subheader">Method 01: Co-Design Session</h3>



    </div>

    <p class="text4">A co-design session refers to a collaborative design approach where a diverse group of stakeholders, including users, designers, product managers, and relevant team members, come together to tackle the design of a product, service, or user interface. The primary objective of a co-design session is to harness the collective wisdom, creativity, and insights of all participants in order to develop a user-centric solution.
      <br><br>
      These sessions are typically organized around specific design challenges or issues, enabling participants to brainstorm solutions and make design choices collaboratively. It can take various formats, such as workshops, focus groups, design sprints, or other structured interactions, all aimed at ensuring that the resulting design aligns closely with the needs and preferences of the end-users. Involving users directly in the design process is fundamental to co-design, as it enhances the likelihood that the final product will meet user expectations effectively.
      <br><br>
      Co-design emerges as the most suitable approach for our project due to the inherently dynamic nature of social events, which can often be impromptu and subject to spontaneous decision-making. Our co-design session commenced with an icebreaker activity, strategically designed to enhance communication and bolster team cohesion. Following this, participants were divided into pairs to delve into the intricacies of the problem space, fostering collaborative brainstorming.
      </p>

    <img class="codesign" src="images/cd1.jpg"></img>

   <p class="text4">Pairs sketched innovative design concepts and created prototypes for constructive feedback. Participants then mapped user interactions via storyboarding, aided by two researchers. One recorded notes, while the other guided teams.
    <br><br>
    We used insights from past interviews for affinity diagramming, identifying key themes to inform sketching and prototyping. Data and field notes from the session revealed recurring themes, providing a foundation for product improvements.</p>

    <img class="codesign2" src="images/cd2.jpg"></img>


   <p class="text4"><strong>Intimacy and commonality</strong> between people are important parts of social event planning. One of our participants discussed the Cornell summer social scene, in which parties were generally larger despite the smaller Cornell student population present on campus, due to the fact that summer students felt they had more in common and had a closer-knit community than during the academic year.
    <br><br>
    Our participants desire to <strong>expand their network in a natural way,”</strong> meaning that they hope to be able to find events that relate to their interests, as they can find other people with similar interests at these events. People felt intimidated to attend events unless they knew people at the events, or knew that the audience was amicable and shared similar interests to them.
    <br><br>
    Our participants discussed the importance of convenience in finding social events, which was demonstrated in particular as one of our participants developed a prototype <strong>monorail to travel around campus near instantaneously.</strong> From this we recognized the importance of enabling students, who generally lack fast transportation, to find events close and convenient to them.

  </p>

    <div class="projectDetail"><h3 class="subheader">Method 02: Auto-Ethnography Combined with Diary Studies
    </h3>

    <p class="text4">In our design context, the participants consist of the four team members, and each member will conduct an auto-ethnographic study focused on an established product within the community platform space. These selected products include Campus Groups, Facebook & Instagram, Cornell Events, and Listserv Gmail. We chose these platforms based on insights gathered from interviews and their widespread use among students. Researchers will utilize these platforms to gain deeper insights into the user's perspective and their overall experiences, thereby contributing to a comprehensive understanding of both the positive and negative aspects of the existing designs.

    <br><br>
     Within the framework of our study, researchers will complete a combined feedback and elicitation diary to capture their thoughts and experiences related to each community platform. This fusion of research methods is instrumental in achieving the project's objectives by enabling us to empathize with the users' socialization processes and uncover the strengths and weaknesses inherent in the current product designs.</p>

    </div>
    <br>
    <img class="codesign" src="images/pie.jpg"></img>

    <p class="text4">It was shown that word of mouth and text was the most frequent method used for finding social events, with usage at 38.5% of the time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <img class="codesign" src="images/table.jpg"></img>

    <p class="text4">We asked our participants to determine the utility of the technology used in searching for events from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most useful and 1 being the least useful. In analyzing this data, we calculated the average score of each tool and found that email listservs, word of mouth, and text were the most effective.

      <br><br>

    However, this may be because these tools require a user to “opt-in” (subscribe or join a friend network), whereas CampusGroups and Cornell events are not personalized to the individual and offer a generalized experience, while social media tools offer a mix of opt-in (following users) and exploratory (recommended) content. Overall, the more personalized the tool was, the higher the average score.
    </p>

    <img class="codesign3" src="images/table2.jpg"></img>

    <p class="text4">In finding events of interest, we found that word of mouth, Facebook/Instagram, and Listservs similarly enabled users to find events of interest with a low unsuccessful rate, whereas CampusGroups and Cornell Events generally underperformed in helping users find successful events.

      <br><br>

Throughout this research methods, we discovered some <strong>advantages</strong> that these products hold:    </p>

<ul>
  <li class="bullet">Event description and times were most useful in helping find an event to attend.</li>
  <li class="bullet">One helpful feature that a participant mentioned was that “the app could ask me what I’m looking for/what events, rather than me needing to do the heavy lifting of searching clubs to find events that interest me.”</li>
  <li class="bullet">Other useful features were knowing if friends were going to the same event and being able to coordinate with friends as well.</li>
</ul>



<p class="text4"> However, we found common <strong>key issues</strong> in the existing products that needs to be addressed:
</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">Participants often could not find events which they were interested in.</li>
      <li class="bullet">Participants could not find specific information (ex: Zoom link).</li>
      <li class="bullet">Tags cluttered the user interface.</li>
      <li class="bullet"> There was no “form of visual” which made it hard to skim through information quickly.</li>
      <li class="bullet"> People could not filter by events that they were interested in and had to manually sort through information.
      </li>

    <li class="bullet"><strong>Events/Gatherings Swipe Deck.</strong> <br>Inspired by Tinder Swipe , users will have a opportunity to swipe right to get more information on events/gatherings and swipe left to dismiss events/gatherings. These swipe decks are personalized to specific users based on their personality traits and interests from their account setup.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li class="bullet"><strong>Find New Friends with Similar Interests.</strong><br> Users will be matched to people who have similar interests and hobbies. There is a option to create group chats to talk about events and schedule times to go together.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li class="bullet"><strong>View Events that are Favorited and Post Events to Recruit People.</strong> <br>Users can view all events/gatherings that they were interested in going in one page and also have the opportunity to post their own events to the community to spread the word.

  <p class="text1">
    Since the implementation of the finalized prototype of Evently, we conducted more usability sessions to better understand whether this is a system that outshines many of the existing products while satisfying the users' needs and goals. As a result, we received many positive feedback from users and all the stakeholders involved. <br><br>Some key takeaways from this project are:
  </p>

<ul>
<li class="bullet"><strong>In the HCI world, the most outstanding features emerge through collaborative efforts.</strong> <br> Looking at the diverse perspectives that each participant contributed during our co-design session was truly inspiring. It was particularly intriguing to observe that those without technical backgrounds often bring forth boundless ideas, unencumbered by technical constraints. Conversely, our technically adept colleagues provided valuable grounding, serving as a pragmatic sounding board for assessing the feasibility of concepts.
</li>
<br>
<li class="bullet"><strong>Effective products lies in adopting design thinking principles. </strong> <br> Throughout our semester-long project, this framework played a impactful role in shaping our designing sessions and discussions with the team. It served as a guiding force, ensuring that we remained laser-focused and aligned with our objectives.
</li>
<br>
<li class="bullet"><strong>Usability Testing doesn't end after development.</strong> <br> Design embodies an ongoing cycle of refining the user experience, a perpetual endeavor aimed at enhancement. Always find ways to father and listen to user's feedback on the product whether it's in the process of being created or already created. There are always opportunities to make the user experience better.
</li>
